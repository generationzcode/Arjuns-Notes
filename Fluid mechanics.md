## Importance of fluid mechanics
> This course is an industrially relevant course which help students to understand various components of fluid
transport systems used in industry such as pipes, fittings, valves, pumps, blowers, compressors, vacuum
pumps etc. The industrial operations involve heating, cooling of the reactors and other mixing/separation
equipment which is provided by steam boilers, thermic fluid heaters, chillers, cooling towers etc. Many
reactions and separation equipment also require understanding of fluid flow at design, operation and
troubleshooting stage.

## Parts
* [[Fluid Statics]]
* [[Bernoulli's Equation]]
* [[Utility Network]] - anything that isn't part of a process is utility, like chilled water, heating water, steam and nitrogen. Nitrogen is inert (relatively). Brines to reduce freezing point without corroding the machinery
* [[Fluid Moving Machinery]] - pumps, vacuum systems, etc
* [[Particle Dynamics]] - i have no fucking clue what this is
