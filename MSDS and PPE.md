> gotta read the MSDS

* Material Safety datasheet contains many properties and instructions regarding a material
* Required to have if you're a dealer of a chemical and required to read if you're using a chemical
* PPE is important
* Chemical compatibility index shows what we can store together safely and what we cant
* Search independently on MSDS, transportation of chemicals and PPE
* DONT MIX WATER AND ACID 
## MSDS
* Has 8-10 sheets
* When made, who is selling, when was MSDS revised is at the top
* Has identification of chemical - molecular weight, formulae, IUPAC, CAS number, etc
* Relevant uses and uses advised against is another section
* Details of supplier of MSDS
* Section on hazard identification which has GHS classification
* Section on composition - substance, mixture
* Section on first aid measures
* Section on firefighting measures
* Section on accidental release measures
* Section on handling and storage
* Section on physical and chemical properties
> Define flash point, and all - this physical properties section is kinda important so look into it

* Section on stability and reactivity
* Section on the toxicology 
* Section on ecological information - whether it's harmful to the waterbodies and all
* Section on Disposal 
* Section on transport information
## Examples
* Some dude made a solution and accidentally mixed two incompatible chemicals in a small bucket. Chemicals had a violent exothermal reaction and started spewing stuff out of the bucket and man ended up with massive burns. If such a reaction had happened in a big vessel, like loads of guys could've been burned. Poor fellow didn't have any clue what would happen if he mixed those two chemicals
* A thermally unstable material (a peroxide) was being fed from a weigh tank to a reactor, the tank had a leak, so the pipe was full of peroxide because they expected a full repair. Peroxide reached decomposition temperature, pressure shot up and big BOOM and BANG and problem. Moral - always underestimate repair times because **you will ALWAYS be disappointed**
