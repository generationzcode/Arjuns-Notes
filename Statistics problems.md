# Question 1:
>This is really a probability problem

A biotechnology manufacturing firm can produce diagnostic testing kits at a cost if \$20. Each kit for which there is a demandin the week ofproduction can be sold for \$100. However, the half-life of components requires the kti to be scrapped if not used within a week. The cost of scrapping a kit is $5. The weekly demand can be summarized as follows:

1. 0(units demanded) - 0.05 (probability)

2. 50 - 0.4

3. 100 - 0.3

4. 200 - 0.25

How many kits should be sold to maximise the mean earnings of the company?
