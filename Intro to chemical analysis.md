> Introduction to chemical analysis, terminology (technique,method, procedure, protocol), broad classification of analytical techniques, good laboratory practices

* Analytical chemistry is the qualitative and quantitative characterization of matter
## Terminology
* Technique is any chemical or physical principle we can use to study an analyte
* Basically the phenomenon you use to form a method
* A method is the application of a technique for a specific analyte in a specific matrix
* So this is like the intrument
* A procedure is a set of written directions telling us how to apply a method to a particular sample, including information on obtaining samples, handling interferents, and validating results
* Nerdshit

>[!Example in PCA]
>* Technique -> You can use your eyes to see colour
>* Method -> you look at the **piss** to see if yellow when using a urinal
>* Procedure -> The **piss** colour chart and instructions on how to evaluate the colour of your piss given in airport washrooms

## Analytical methodology
* Understanding and defining the problem
* Familiarize with the background of the problem and history of the sample - *understand why you need to solve it and how the sample has come to be*
* Literature search - *see how others have solved similar problems*
* Sampling - *take a small sample to represent a population*
* Prep and pretreatment of sample - *clean the sample, weigh it, etc*
* Analysis - *apply method*
* Apply required statistical techniques - *analyse the data*
* Verify results - *make sure your data isn't skewed, completely incorrect*
* Reporting - *share your results and method with the world or organisaton*
## Classification of analytical methods
### Classical methods
* These are the wet chemical methods, earliest methods of analysis
* Analytes are treated with reagents to form products that could be identified for qualitative classical methods
* Gravimetric and titrimetric methods for the quantitative classical methods
>[!examples]
>* Formation of precipitate and measurement of mass
>* Oxidation of analyte and detection of end via the change of colour of the analyte
>* complexation of analyte and use of metallochromatic indicators to detect end point

* No one likes these methods but boomers
* old nerdshit
### Instrumental methods
* These are the newer techniques with quantification results coming at PPB levels.
* These are more costly compared to classical techniques
* HPLC is an example of a quantitative instrumental technique
* Spectroscopy is an example of a qualitative instrumental technique
