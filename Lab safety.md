#safety 
* Main routes of entry of the chemicals into the human body are: Inhalation into the lungs, Absorption through skin, Ingestion
* Chemical safety and Chemical security are two important aspects of lab safety
* Chemical safety is to protect people from chemicals
* Chemical security is to protect chemicals from bad people
## Corrosive
![[Pasted image 20240701113218.png]]
* Examples are: sulfuric acid, nitric acid, potassium hydroxide
* Corrosive substances cause destructive burns on the tissue by chemical action at the site of contact
* Corrosive effect can also happen in respiratory tract or gastrointestinal tract
## Oxidisers
![[Pasted image 20240701113320.png]]
* Examples - hydrogen peroxide, nitric acid, perchloric acid, etc.
* They readily decompose under certain conditions to yield oxygen
* They can cause a fire to burn violently
* Oxidisers musn't be stored with flammables
## Flammables
![[Pasted image 20240701113546.png]]
* These readily catch fire and burn in air
* The vapours released from a flammable liquid are a common fire hazard in a laboratory
* The degree of hazard associated with a flammable liquid depends on it's ==flash point, flammability limit and ignition temperature==
## Explosives
![[Pasted image 20240701113614.png]]
* When subjected to heat, impact or friction, undergoes a rapid chemical change evolving large volumes of gases which cause a sudden increase in pressure
* Examples - acetylides, azides, nitrogen triiodide, organic peroxides
* perchloric acid if allowed to dry on wood or other combustibles,will explode and cause a fire on impact or friction
* picric acid and picrates are detonated by heat and impact 

## Toxic Substances
* LD50 - lethal dosage 50 milligrams
* Toxic chemicals produce injurious or lethal effects upon contact with body cells due to their chemical properties
* ![[Pasted image 20240701114143.png]]
## Pyrophoric
* same sign as flammable 
* The rapid oxidation of a pyrophoric chemical by oxygen or moisture in the air causes the compound to ignite spontaneously
## Water reactive chemicals
These chemicals react violentl when they come in contact with water
* Examples  - lithium, sodium, potassium, aluminium, etc

## Ordering of chemicals
* always order the smallest quantity of chemical.
* The risk of an event occurring reduces
* Where possible, purchase a less hazardous chemical
## Receipt of chemicals
![[Pasted image 20240701115336.png]]
* Received packages must be checked to ensure that the containers arein good condition
* Details of new chemicals must be entered in the lab inventory 
* The date of receipt and date of first usage should be recorded for shelf life calculation
* Ensure the MSDS is obtained with the chemical and is readily available for reference
## Storage of chemicals
* Bulk stocks must be stored in a separate building
* A spill or fire involving bulk containers will be difficult to tackle
* Chemicals must be grouped according to their properties
![[Pasted image 20240701115810.png]]
* Oxidisers, flammables, acids, bases, reproductive toxins and carcinogens are all to be stored separately 
* Keep shelves at max height 1.5 meters so short people don't burn down the building. Fix the shelf to the wall to prevent it's fall
* Store heavier bottles lower
> The japanese are very disciplined people. Look at five S

* USE lab purpose fridges
## Handling of chemicals
* chemical formulae or short forms must not be used to label.
* Labels must include the hazard and brief description of it![[Pasted image 20240701121329.png]]
## Chemical spilles
* Chemical spill kits
* PPE
* Scoops and dustpans
* Dry Sand
## other stuff
* ==examine inventory annually==
* ==safety is good==
* ==don't burn down the lab==
* ==dont be a foolish fellow==
