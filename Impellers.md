Impellers are used in reactors to mix fluids to make the solution homogeneous. In real life, backmix flow is never really achieved but we can get close to it by effective selection of impeller type that suits a particular set of properties of the material being mixed

## Classification
* Propeller - For axial flow, low viscosity
* Turbine - For axial or radial flow, high or low viscosity
* Paddle - slow mixing
### Propeller
* This provides an axial flow current in the liquid. It rotates at very high speeds and is best suited for low viscosity materials.
* They rarely exceed 18 inch diameter.
* The flow current continues in one direction till deflected by a wall.
* It has a property called the "pitch" which is calculated by dividing the distance axially traveled by propelled liquid by the diameter of the propeller.
* Types of propeller include - marine propeller and hydrofoil propeller
* **Marine propellers** are very commonly used, named after the kind used to propel boats.
* **Hydrofoil propellers** are the most efficient in regard to energy consumption
### Turbines
* These work in any condition - high or low viscosity 
* They run at high speeds and are of complex made
* They represent multi-bladed paddles - the blades may be vertical, pitched or curved
* Near the impeller, there is intense turbulence and high shear(which may not be suitable for many applications)
* Principle currents are tangential and radial - thus these provide **turbulent flow**. To lower tangential component, a diffuser ring can be added to the turbine
* Types of turbines include - straight turbines, pitched turbines, disc turbine and open turbine
* Straight turbines have straight or curved blades angled upwards
* Pitched turbines have a defined angle with straight blades for better axial and radial flow
* Disc turbines have a disc with curved blades at the end - good for keeping solids suspended 
* Open turbines have holes in the blades to help them move faster
### Paddles
* These are gentle and slow agitators for low to medium viscosity tanks
* There are many types of paddles - marine paddle, flat paddle, anchor paddle, gate paddle and finger paddle
* Paddles are in general used to mantain lower shear intensity in liquids compared to even propellers, facilitate heat transfer and to keep solids suspended. A great example for paddles is in fermentation - where high shear can kill the bacteria in the reactor
