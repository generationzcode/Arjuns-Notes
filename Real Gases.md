> Ideal gases never liquify

On increasing pressure, gases behave real-ly
* because the molecules are close to each other and the interaction between molecules will be non zero
* The molecules have finite size, this also affects the interactions between molecules at high pressure


>[!Mean free path] Mean free path
Mean free path is a measure of how close molecules are
$$\lambda = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}\pi d^2N}$$
d= diameter
N = number of molecules per unit volume = $$\frac{\rho}{MN_A}$$


| Pressure<br>(bar) | $$\frac{V}{n} = \frac{RT}{P}$$ | N(number<br>of molecules<br>per unit volume) | $$\lambda$$(Angstrom) |
