> fire is bad

* Fire is a rapid chemical reaction of an oxidant with a fuel, accompanies by the release of energy, indicated by the incandescence of a flame
* Flame triangle is something
* For a fire to occur you need - oxidiser,heat and fuel. A good arsenist knows how to control all 3 to make a good disaster.
* During a fire, heat transfer occurs using conduction, convection AND radiation. WOW
* Ignition needs to be looked at - open flame, hot surfaces, sparks from welding, smoking, batteries
* Flash point is the lowest temperature at which a liquid produces enough vapour to form an ignitable mixture
* In a flammable fire, the material doesnt burn unless in vapour form - only the vapours burn
## Types of fires
* Class A fire - Solid combustible materials of organic nature such as wood, paper, rubber, plastics, etc
* Class B fires - Caused by flammable liquids
* Class C fires - Flammable gases under pressure
* Class D fires - Caused by combustible metals
## How to extinguish a fire
* Cooling the fuel - apply water
* Smothering - removing the oxidant supply by using foam or CO2
* Starving the fire by removing the fuel
* Inhibition by stopping the chain reaction by adding dry chemical powder
